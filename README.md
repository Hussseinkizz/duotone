5. Then make a pull request and if you are making a pull request, please give me a screenshot of before/after!
6. That's it, and after successfully merging your changes to the main, you wil be credited on behalf of the community for making such a heartful contribution.


## Do you have any suggestions?

First, this theme is new so if something is off the grid, please open an issue. Because, there are many languages and parts of VS Code I don't know about, so let me know if anything goes wrong.

If you would like to change something personally, you can either open a PR and see if I'd like it added, or override the colours in your own settings.json file.

Start upon that here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference


Also file issues [here](https://github.com/Hussseinkizz/duotone/issues), or [submit PRs](https://github.com/Hussseinkizz/duotone/pulls) if you like.

## Credits

I take this opportunity to whole heartedly thank [Danny Banks](https://twitter.com/dbanksdesign) for making the [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com) framework which helped me to make this really fast and with ease, else developing a VScode theme is a hard task only fit for gods. So thanks Danny and all users who recommend this theme to thier friends.
